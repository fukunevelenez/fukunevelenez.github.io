## About me
I'm a PhD student in the [Brain and Cognitive Science Area of Department of Psychology](https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/brain-and-cognitive-science/) working with [Payam Piray](https://www.piraylab.com/) at the University of Southern California. My research lies at the intersection of computational cognitive science and artificial intelligence. I study how humans learn, adapt, and make decisions in complex, dynamic environments. I am particularly interested in how both humans and machines generalize from past experiences to make (sub)optimal decisions. My work explores questions such as how environmental noise and uncertainty influence individual decision-making strategies, and how collective decision processes emerge within groups. To address these challenges, I draw on methods from Bayesian inference, reinforcement learning, dynamical systems modeling, and language models.

Before joining USC, I worked with Prof. Bonan Zhao and Prof. Natalia Vélez at Princeton University, where I used Bayesian inference to investigate how humans approach explore–exploit decision-making and how language models handle similar decision scenarios. I also collaborated with Prof. Dor Abrahamson and Dr. Sofia Tancredi at the University of California, Berkeley, studying the relationship between physiological data and children’s mathematical cognition. I received my B.A. in Cognitive Science and Mathematics from Carleton College. At Carleton, I worked with Prof. Justin London, Prof. Anna Rafferty, and Prof. Kathie Galotti on the role of implicit prior knowledge in causal inductive reasoning, with Prof. Joseph Johnson on modeling opinion dynamics using partial differential equations, and with Prof. Rob Thompson on problems in geometric optimization. 

### My other interests 
Outside of research, I enjoy going to the gym, swimming, and playing the double bass. I’m passionate about the ocean and am learning freediving!
